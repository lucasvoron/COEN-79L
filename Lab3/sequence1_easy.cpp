// INVARIANT for the sequence ADT (i.e. verbalization of rules governing
//   private member function behavior):
//   1. The number of items in the sequence is in the member variable used
//      (i.e. used = 0 means the sequence is empty).
//   2. For an empty sequence, we do not care what is stored in any of the
//      array data.  For a non-empty sequence, the items in the sequence are
//      stored in strictly maintained order in data[0] through
//      data[used].  We don't care what's in the rest of data (so don't
//      need to initialize data in the constructor).
//   3. To maintain strict order, current_index is used to keep track
//      of current location in data; when current_index is used-1,
//      we're at the last place in the array.  Also whenever current_index
//      is greater than or equal to used, there is no current item.
//   4. capacity keeps track of the current capacity of the array pointed
//      to by data; capacity starts out with the value initial_capacity
//      and is changed by resize as needed (whenever used is greater than
//      or equal to capacity).
